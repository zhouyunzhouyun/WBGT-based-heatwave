This study has three main research aims:
1) To estimate the daily WBGT by integrating the temperature and humidity for China from 1980 to 2019. 
2) To provide a unique definition of extreme events for each province. 
3) To describe the variation in heatwaves from national, regional, and provincial perspectives across the country.
